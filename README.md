# mandarin_data
Collection of data resources and analyses I've made while learning Mandarin Chinese

## flashcards
Files that can be uploaded to the [Pleco app](https://www.pleco.com/) to make flashcards for studying. I made these by translating English words into Simplified characters (and pinyin) and aggregating them into a Google Sheet, which can be exported into a `.tsv` and easily uploaded to Pleco. See UI screenshot for upload settings.
