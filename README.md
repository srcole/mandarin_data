# mandarin_data
Collection of data resources and analyses I've made while learning Mandarin Chinese

## Spreadsheets
Currently, I find it most useful to maintain Google spreadsheets because they are easily viewable, shareable, editable, and study-able.
1. [Song lyrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAy3Oo53x1CVEFCLPrcnqL-NocqcWwcAqBj7PwSkQq0): translations of lyrics for some popular songs
2. [Modal particles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UNGn-9ebiJQnE_3RJoEG3hLnH_-M08_VzbnNwzAseCg/edit?gid=184858178#gid=184858178): descriptions of many modal particles, characters used in written communication to adjust the tone of messages
3. [Metro stations - top characters](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UNGn-9ebiJQnE_3RJoEG3hLnH_-M08_VzbnNwzAseCg/edit?gid=972030455#gid=972030455): Most common characters appearing in metro station names. Also see [ths sheet of most common pairs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UNGn-9ebiJQnE_3RJoEG3hLnH_-M08_VzbnNwzAseCg/edit?gid=687489175#gid=687489175)

## flashcards
Files that can be uploaded to the [Pleco app](https://www.pleco.com/) to make flashcards for studying. I made these by translating English words into Simplified characters (and pinyin) and aggregating them into a Google Sheet, which can be exported into a `.tsv` and easily uploaded to Pleco. See UI screenshot for upload settings.
- maps: made while using 高德地图
- menus: made from pictures I took of many menus
